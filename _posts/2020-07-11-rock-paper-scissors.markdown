Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are rock &#x270A;, paper &#x270B;, and scissors &#x270C;.

It's a simple and yet funny game I used to play a lot back in my teenage years, so I decided to make a web version that I could play when bored.

Since I'm not an exceptional designer, I borrowed the designs from [Frontend Mentor][frontend-mentor].

Tech stack I used was:
- React
- Redux
- Styled Components
