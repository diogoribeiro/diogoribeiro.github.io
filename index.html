                  Hi, I’m Diogo Ribeiro, a Brazilian software engineer. Coding has been my hobby since I was 17 when I used to build simple web pages using HTML and CSS just for fun.
                  Once I got in touch with software development I knew that was what I wanted to work on because it amazed me,
                  I loved and still love the fact that I can write computer instructions that are going to give life to computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’ve been working professionally as a software engineer since 2010 ever since I’ve had the opportunity to work with a lot of different
                  technologies (javascript, ruby, .net, java, groovy), platforms (web, desktop, embedded),
                  frameworks (Rails, React, Grails), always focusing on delivering high-quality software, well tested, with beautiful design,
                  with value for the client and in a fair amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've been working remotely for 2 years now, moreover, I'm also helping mentoring young devs which helped me to improve my communication skills
                </p>

                  Throughout of the years, I’ve been working as a software development I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects that
                  used interesting front-end technologies such as React, SASS, Handlebars, jQuery, HTML5, etc.

              <div>
                <p>
                  I also worked on the back-end side of projects and so far I could work with Java and its main frameworks like spring
                  and hibernate, Ruby and Ruby on Rails and Groovy and its main framework Grails. While working with these technologies
                  I used automation test tools (Junit and Rspec) and build tools (Gradle and Rake).
