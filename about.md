I’m Diogo Ribeiro, a senior software engineer. Passionate about software, I’ve been coding for more than ten years, translating ideas to software, and transforming concepts into products.

As a software engineer, I’ve worked as a fullstack, back end, and front end developer using different technologies such as Java, Ruby ( Ruby on Rails ), Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
